    "\n",
    "Repetitive sequences are a huge problem for genome annotation. Some repeats only coincidentally look like protein-coding genes, others (such as transposases) are protein-coding genes, but we usually are not interested in any of these \"repeat genes\" when trying to find protein-coding genes in a novel genome. Thus, a genome should be repeat-masked prior gene prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat masking is a resource and time-consuming step that is out of scope for this workshop. We recommend using RepeatModeler2 ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921046117), [software](https://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/) ) to construct a species-specific repeat library and mask the genome with RepeatMasker (ideally, you will perform these computations on a node with >70 threads, in a place with very fast storage i/o, possibly using RAM instead of actual hard drive as a temporary file storage place):\n",

    "## Annotation of protein coding genes\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural genome annotation is ideally performed by a combination of a statistical model (e.g. Hidden Markov Model derivate) and extrinsic evidence (e.g. from transcriptomics or known protein sequences). The statistical model parameters have to be adapted to the genomic properties of novel species. For adapting parameters, an initial set of high-quality training genes from the target species is required. This is tricky to obtain. BRAKER is a perl script that comprises several pipelines to automated the solution of this problem: fully automatically generate an initial set of training genes, train gene finders, and then predict genes with the trained parameters and extrinsic evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first take an approach to structural genome annotation that takes advantage both of RNA-Seq data, and a large database of known proteins, using BRAKER3 ([poster from PAG2023](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lars-Gabriel-3/publication/367409816_The_BRAKER3_Genome_Annotation_Pipeline/links/63d14cbae922c50e99c29c7a/The-BRAKER3-Genome-Annotation-Pipeline.pdf), [software](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER)). If sufficient transcriptome data is available, then BRAKER3 is usually the best choice of pipeline. However, in the lack of transcriptome data, we need to consider alternative approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "If transcriptome evidence is available but it just was not sufficient for obtaining good results with BRAKER3, then running BRAKER1 with RNA-Seq evidence ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv661)) and protein supported gene prediction with BRAKER2 ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqaa108)), combined by TSEBRA ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04482-0), [software](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/TSEBRA)) is often a good option.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the total absence of transcriptome data, we recommend running either BRAKER2 with a large database of proteins, alone, or for larger genomes (such as vertebrates), we the recommend application of GALBA ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.10.536199v1.abstract), [software](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/GALBA)) with reference proteomes of a few closely related, already annotated species.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BRAKER3\n",
    "\n",
    "BRAKER3 uses spliced aligned RNA-Seq data from Hisat2 ([paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0201-4), [software](https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/hisat2)) for genome-guided transcriptome assembly with Stringtie ([paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3122), [software](https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie)). GeneMarkS-T ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/12/e78/2902598), [software](http://exon.gatech.edu/genemark/license_download.cgi)) is used to call protein coding genes in the transcripts. These transcripts are \"noisy\", therefore, a large database of proteins (e.g. an OrthoDB partition) is used to filter these predictions, using among other GeneMark-specific scripts including ProtHint ([software](https://github.com/gatech-genemark/ProtHint)) with Spaln ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/24/21/2438/191484), [software](https://github.com/ogotoh/spaln)) the fast search tool DIAMOND ([paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01101-x), [software](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond)). Both, the transcriptome and protein evidence is then used by GeneMark-ETP ([preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.13.524024v1), [software](https://github.com/gatech-genemark/GeneMark-ETP)) for self-training this HMM-based gene finder. This generates a training set for AUGUSTUS ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btn013), [software](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus)). Both, the GeneMark-ETP, and the AUGUSTUS gene set incorporate the evidence to some extent, and these gene sets are merged with TSEBRA by BRAKER3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training AUGUSTUS for a novel species usually comprises a step called etraining that adapts species-specific parameters of the statistical model of AUGUSTUS, and a step called optimize_augustus.pl that optimizes meta-parameters of that model. optimize_augustus.pl is very time-consuming, it yields usually ~2 percent points of accuracy on gene level. For this session, will disable this step with --skipOptimize. If you ever want to annotate a real new genome, make sure to delete `--skipOptimize` from your BRAKER calls (and expect substantially longer runtime). Also, GeneMark-ETP usually has a longer runtime. We will here set the maximal intergenic region for GeneMark-ETP to 10000. Please never apply this setting to a real genome annotation task, and expect a larger runtime."

In contrast to the BRAKER2 and BRAKER3 pipelines, GALBA is not very good at using remotely related protein evidence. However, given reference proteins of several closely related species, GALBA is very good at recovering gene structures, particularly in large vertebrate genomes.

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### I have 80.000 genes predicted by BRAKER/TSEBRA in a full genome, what shall I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please first check whether you are referring to genes, or to transcripts. BRAKER predicts alternative isoforms. If RNA-Seq data supports this, the number of alternative transcripts may be large, but likely true. If it's really genes that you counted, then 80.000 sounds way too much, indeed. Most likely, GeneMark-ET/ES/EP/ETP produced highly fragmented training genes for AUGUSTUS. This will also lead to highly fragmented genes predicted by AUGUSTUS. First, check whether you genome has been masked for repeats. Consider using the additional TRF masking desribed at the top of this notebook. If that does not help, and if you have a protein set of closely related species at hand, consider using that protein set as sole training data for AUGUSTUS. You can use GALBA for this (https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/GALBA).\n",
    "\n",
    "### I have only 10.000 genes predicted by BRAKER/TSEBRA in a full genome, what shall I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Check whether the BRAKER output files in subfolders Augustus and GeneMark-* produced more genes than TSEBRA. By default, TSEBRA will discard genes without evidence. If you have only little evidence for your species, TSEBRA might be a bad idea. You can also try rerunning TSEBRA with enforcing one of the gene sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I know how many genes to expect?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard to say. You can download gene sets of related species e.g. from NCBI Genomes, and count. Some gene sets tend to be \"underannotated\", i.e. they may represent rather the lower numbers of what might be realistic. Katharina usually gets nervous about more than 45000 genes and fewer than 15000 genes. These are definitely weird gene counts. Otherwise: always inspect your gene set in a Genome Browser such as the UCSC Genome Browser to identify problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I have long isoseq RNA-Seq transcripts, can I put them into BRAKER?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. But we have [other instructions](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER/blob/master/docs/long_reads/long_read_protocol.md) for you. Please note: isoseq data does not always aid structural genome annotation over short read RNA-Seq data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The BUSCO scores of my genome are higher than those of my protein, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some short housekeeping genes are commonly masked during repeat masking. They won't show up in a BRAKER gene set. You can manually add them from BUSCO output to a final gene set. We currently do not provide an automated workflow for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I opened an issue on GitHub about BRAKER or TSEBRA 100 days ago, nobody replied, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are a small team of developers. We try our best and usually respond to well described and easy-to-solve issues within a rather short time frame. Solving other issues may take considerable amounts of time that we simply do not have, or they may be described in a way that we don't know what do with them... please be patient with us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I have a problem, whom do I tell?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read through the Issues on Github. If the issue does not exist, yet, open an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ready to move on?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel confident about your skills, take them to the next level. We have prepared an entire small genome in the following notebook: [Annotate_Hymenolepsis_microstoma.py](Annotate_Hymenolepsis_microstoma.py). We highly recommend that you create a group with several peers in order to reduce runtime (i.e. distribute tasks to people).\n",
